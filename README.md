Attached in this repo is my Bachelor's Thesis within Mathematical Statistics, written at Stockholm University.

The topic of the thesis is Bayesian Portfolio Optimization, based on the methods developed in the papers [”Bayesian mean–
variance analysis: optimal portfolio selection under parameter uncertainty”](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0096300322002041?via%3Dihub) and [”Bayesian portfolio selection using VaR and CVaR”](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14697688.2020.1748214).
